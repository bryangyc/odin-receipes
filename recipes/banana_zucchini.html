    <h3>Banana Zucchini Bread Ingredients</h3>
    These are the ingredients you'll need to make this banana zucchini bread recipe: 
    <ul>
        <li>
            Eggs: Three eggs add moisture and help hold the batter together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, lends even more moisture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sugars: This banana zucchini bread recipe calls for both brown and white sugars.
        </li>
        <li>
            Zucchini and bananas: Of course, you'll need grated zucchini and mashed bananas!
        </li>
        <li>
            Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of this simple quick bread.
        </li>
        <li>
            Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana zucchini bread structure.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon lends welcome pleasant warmth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.
        </li>
        <li>
            Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make your bread taste salty.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cranberries: Dried cranberries give the bread bursts of fruity flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Walnuts: Chopped walnuts add crunch and nutty flavor. 
        </li>
    </ul>
